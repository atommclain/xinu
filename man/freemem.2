.B int freestk(addr, len)

.SH DESCRIPTION
In either form,
.I freemem
deallocates a contiguous block of memory previously obtained with the
.I getmem
or
.I getstk
system calls GETMEM(2), and returns it to the free list.
Argument \f2addr\f1 specifies the address of the block being deallocated,
and argument \f2len\f1 specifies the length of the block in bytes.
For memory allocated by
.I getstk
argument \f2addr\f1 specifies the highest word address of the block being
deallocated; for memory allocated by
.I getmem
argument \f2addr\f1 specifies the lowest word address of the block.
These definitions are consistent with the addresses returned by calls to
.I getstk
and
.I getmem .
In this version, memory is allocated in  multiples of eight bytes to
guarantee that sufficient space is available in each block to link it
onto the free list.
However, the length passed to both \f2getmem\f1 and \f2freemem\f1 is
rounded automatically, so the user need not be aware of any extra space in
the allocated block.
