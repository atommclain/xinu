.TH SH 1
.SH NAME
sh \- invoke a subshell to interpret commands
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Sh
creates a separate, fresh invocation of the command interpreter (shell).
.I Sh
is most useful for executing command scripts with the input taken from a
file or another window.
However, recursive invocation of interactrive shells works as expected \-
the user interacts with the innermost (most recent) shell, returning to
the next outer shell after the inner shell terminates.
.SH SEE ALSO
exit(1), help(1), logout(1), who(1)
